Details of COVID-19 data set of Saudi Arabia

This data set "saudi-arabia-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-situation" is extracted from the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC) Data Portal (2021, September). Sourced from the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia via KAPSARC data portal.

I modified the format of the data to have it for cities and regions with including the longitude and latitude of each city.
